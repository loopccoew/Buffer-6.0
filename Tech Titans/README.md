Problem Statement:

Develop a Real-Time Identity Theft Detection System using Java Data Structures to identify and prevent fraudulent activities such as unauthorized logins, fake account creations, and abnormal transactions.

Description:

Identity theft is a serious threat, leading to financial fraud and security breaches across banking and e-commerce platforms. This intelligent system leverages the power of Java Data Structures to detect and respond to anomalies in real-time.

Key Components & Techniques:

HashMap 🗺️: Tracks login locations and devices. Flags any suspicious or unusual access points, helping detect unauthorized logins.

Queue ⏳: Monitors failed login attempts. Prevents brute-force attacks by triggering alerts after a defined threshold is exceeded.

Tree (BST) 🌲: Maintains transaction history for each user. Enables fast retrieval and identification of abnormal spending patterns.

LinkedList 🔗: Stores recent fraud reports and alerts for real-time monitoring and quick incident response.

Together, these data structures form a robust detection engine that adapts and responds to threats dynamically, ensuring enhanced security, user trust, and platform integrity.
