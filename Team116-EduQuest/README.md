Problem Statement: With the growing demand for continuous learning and skill development, individuals often turn to online courses(MOOKs platforms) to advance their knowledge. However, the sheer volume of available courses makes it difficult to identify the ones that truly align with a learner’s specific needs. Traditional course discovery methods are often generic and lack personalization, resulting in time-consuming searches and courses that may not match the user’s goals, prior experience, available time, or budget.
To address this challenge,we have derived a solution that simplifies the course selection process by providing personalized recommendations. By considering user inputs such as time commitment, financial constraints, current knowledge level, and learning objectives, the platform can help optimize the learning journey and enhance overall user satisfaction.

Data structures & Algorithms used:
1.	List : Stores all courses for filtering, searching, and sorting operations.
2.	HashMap: Maps each courseId to its corresponding CourseInfo object.
3.	Priority queue : Maintains a priority-based ordering of courses by rating (highest to lowest)
4.	Regex (Pattern & Matcher) Algorithm: Keyword highlighting
