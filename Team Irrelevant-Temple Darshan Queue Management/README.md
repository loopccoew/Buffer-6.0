# üõï Temple Darshan Queue Management System

Our project comes under the **Custom Data Structure** theme. It is a **command-line based queue management system** for organizing darshan (visits) at a temple. The system ensures **fair, efficient, and prioritized** handling of visitors based on their category such as VIPs, senior citizens, disabled individuals, and general public. It uses a round-robin approach to serve visitors in a fair manner while also giving priority to those who need it most.

## üöÄ Features

- Add new visitors with details like name, age, and category.
- Automatically upgrade visitors aged 60 and above from General to Senior category.
- Fair processing of visitors using a **round-robin algorithm** across all categories.
- Separate queues for VIP, Disabled, Senior, and General visitors.
- Real-time queue display for each category.
- Easy-to-use text-based interface.

## üìä Data Structures Used

### üîÅ `deque` (from `collections` library)

- **Purpose**: Used for each category‚Äôs queue.
- **Why**: `deque` is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends. This makes it perfect for queue operations (FIFO - First In, First Out).
- Four separate deques are maintained for:
  - `VIP`
  - `DISABLED`
  - `SENIOR`
  - `GENERAL`

## üß† Algorithm & Logic

### üßæ Visitor Addition Logic

1. Every new visitor is assigned a unique `token` (auto-incremented).
2. If a visitor is aged 60 or more and belongs to the `GENERAL` category, they are **automatically upgraded to the `SENIOR` category**.
3. Based on the final category, the visitor is added to the respective queue.

### üîÑ Fair Processing Algorithm (Round-Robin)

1. Categories are arranged in a fixed round-robin order:
   - `VIP` ‚Üí `DISABLED` ‚Üí `SENIOR` ‚Üí `GENERAL`
2. The system maintains a `category_index` to track the current category to process.
3. On every process request:
   - Check if the queue for the current category is non-empty.
   - If yes, dequeue (process) one visitor from it.
   - Move to the next category in the order for future processing.
   - If no visitors are present in the current category, skip to the next.
4. This ensures **fairness** by allowing every category a turn while prioritizing categories with people waiting.

## üîÑ System Workflow

1. User is shown a menu with 4 options:
   - Add Visitor
   - Process Next Visitor
   - Show Queue
   - Exit

2. **Add Visitor**:
   - User enters:
     - Name
     - Age
     - Category (`VIP`, `Disabled`, `Senior`, or `General`)
   - A visitor token is assigned.
   - If age ‚â• 60 and category is `GENERAL`, visitor is upgraded to `SENIOR`.

3. **Process Next Visitor**:
   - The system checks each queue in round-robin fashion.
   - If a visitor is found in the current category, they are processed (removed from the queue).
   - Category index is updated to ensure fairness.

4. **Show Queue**:
   - Displays all waiting visitors in each category.

5. **Exit**:
   - Ends the program.

## üéØ Why This Approach?

- **Priority Handling**: Important groups like VIPs, disabled, and senior citizens get prioritized without starving the general public.
- **Efficiency**: `deque` provides O(1) time complexity for enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Fairness**: Round-robin ensures all categories are served without bias.
- **Simplicity**: The system is lightweight and easy to maintain or expand in the future.
