Problem Statement : Group payments often lead to delays and confusion. There's a need for a seamless solution that enables instant settlement of transactions among friends to avoid reimbursement hassles and streamline the process.

Solution :- 
1) Group Payment Pooling: All group members contribute their share simultaneously into a common pool. 
2) Instant Settlement: Once the full amount is collected, it is instantly transferred to the shopkeeper in a single transaction. 
3) Real-Time Notifications: Everyone in the group gets notified about contributions and completion of payment. 
4) Transparent Records: Maintains a clear log of who paid and when, avoiding disputes. 
5) Merchant Convenience: Shopkeepers receive a single consolidated payment, reducing confusion and wait time. 

Data Structures used : 
1) ArrayList - Used to store lists of members in a group and the predefined contact list respectively.
2) HashSet - Used to store and check for already selected contact IDs.
3) HashMap - Used to store previous groups along with their member data.
