## 🔍 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced learning environment, students often struggle with **managing time**, **prioritizing concepts**, and **retaining knowledge** effectively — especially with complex topics like DSA. Our project, **Smart Study Scheduler**, aims to revolutionize the way students learn by creating a fully **customizable, intelligent, and interactive study companion**.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Smart Study Scheduler  
Input your **available study time** and **topics to be covered**, and the app will automatically generate a **personalized timeline**. It honors **topic dependencies** (e.g., Strings → Recursion → Graphs) to ensure foundational concepts are tackled before advanced ones.

### 2. 🧾 Flashcard Revision  
Enhance retention through **interactive flashcards**. Users are presented with **conceptual questions** and receive **detailed explanations** upon answering, reinforcing deeper understanding.

### 3. ⏰ Spaced Revision Reminder  
Our built-in scheduler notifies users at **strategic intervals** for revision, following proven learning models like **spaced repetition**, ensuring long-term memory retention.

### 4. 📊 Progress Tracker  
Monitor your daily and weekly performance. Visual cues, percentage completion, and streaks help keep you **motivated and accountable**.

## 📚 Data Structures Used
- **🔗 Graphs & DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** → Core to managing topic dependencies. Each topic is a node, and prerequisite relationships (e.g., Strings → Graphs) form directed edges. Ensures proper sequencing in the study plan.

- **📐 Topological Sorting** → Applied on the DAG to generate a valid, dependency-respecting order of topics. Ensures that foundational concepts are covered before advanced ones (e.g., Sorting before DP).

- **⏫ Priority Queues** → Used to schedule topics smartly based on priority levels and estimated time inputs.

- **🔍 Hash Maps** → Widely used to store:Flashcard data (question-answer pairs),Topic-wise estimated study time,User progress status,Topic dependencies.

- **🔄 Stacks & Queues** → Used for:Flashcard revision flow,Spaced revision reminders (queue-based notification system),Dynamic topic handling during scheduling.

- **📋 Arrays & Linked Lists** → Used for creating tracks, storing timeline plans, and maintaining ordered study schedules.

- **✅ Sets** → To mark and track completed topics for dynamic progress visualization.
