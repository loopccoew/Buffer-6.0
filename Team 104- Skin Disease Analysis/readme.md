🧠 **Skin Disease Analyzer & Severity Predictor using Custom Data Structures** 
🩺 Overview: This project is a hybrid intelligence system for analyzing skin disease images, assessing severity, and recommending treatments. It is uniquely designed using custom-built data structures that integrate trees, graphs, tries, hash maps, and lists — tailored to optimize medical image analysis, data retrieval, and adaptive decision-making.

🔍 Key Features Multi-scale lesion detection via a hybrid Segment Tree and Quadtree.

Adaptive image enhancement using Skip Lists.

Fast feature similarity search with a KD-Tree.

Disease correlation via a Symptom Graph.

Severity scoring based on weighted CSV rules.

Treatment recommendations via intelligent HashMaps.

Symptom-to-disease prediction using Trie-Graph hybrids (future scope).

📊 Custom Data Structures and Their Roles

Structure Purpose 📐 Segment Tree + Quadtree Region-based lesion segmentation and multi-scale localization 📋 Skip List Adaptive image filtering (contrast, denoising) 🌲 KD-Tree Feature-based nearest neighbor search (color, shape, texture) 🕸️ Feature Correlation Graph Symptom co-occurrence mapping and analysis 🧮 HashMap (Disease/Treatment Info) Quick lookup of treatment protocol, severity scores, and symptom map 🔤 Trie (Planned Feature) Autocomplete and symptom-to-disease navigation 🔁 Process Flow

Image Acquisition & Preprocessing The uploaded image is split using a hybrid Segment Tree + Quadtree.
Adaptive filters (denoising, sharpening, contrast normalization) applied using a Skip List.

Feature Extraction & Disease Matching Features are extracted using custom functions (color histograms, edge maps).
Features are embedded into a KD-Tree.

Nearest matches are queried to find likely diseases.

A Feature Correlation Graph (Adjacency List + HashMap) identifies co-occurring symptoms.

Disease Severity Scoring Disease-specific weights are loaded from severity_weights.csv.
A custom formula computes a numeric severity score.

Treatment Recommendation Using the match from KD-Tree and severity index, treatment suggestions are retrieved from a HashMap.

Symptom to Disease Prediction (planned) Input symptoms will be parsed via Trie and connected to diseases using a graph structure.
