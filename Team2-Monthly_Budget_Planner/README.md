This Java-based project implements a console-driven monthly budget planning application that enables users to allocate budgets across multiple categories, log daily expenses, and monitor overall financial activity. It provides essential features such as category-wise tracking, overspending alerts, deletion of budget categories, forecasting, and exporting data to a CSV file. A dedicated "Miscellaneous" category automatically captures unregistered expenses, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all spending.

Data Structure used in our code
To manage and organize the data efficiently, the application uses several HashMap<String, Double> structures. These include categoryBudgetMap for storing budget limits for each category, categoryRemainingMap for tracking how much budget is left, categorySpentMap for recording the total spent per category, and miscBreakdown for listing expenses that donâ€™t belong to any defined category. HashMaps are used because they allow quick access and updates, which is important for a responsive budgeting tool.
