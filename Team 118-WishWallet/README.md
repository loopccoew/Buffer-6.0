# 📱 WishWallet – A Goal-Based Digital Piggy Bank

**WishWallet** is a smart savings Android application designed to help users set financial goals and automatically allocate their saved money toward those goals using classic DSA concepts like Priority Queue, HashMap, and a Greedy Algorithm.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Saving money is a habit most people struggle with—especially students and young earners who often lack structured saving tools. Traditional budgeting apps can be too complex or overwhelming for users with simple goals like buying a gadget, funding a trip, or building emergency funds.

**WishWallet** aims to solve this by providing a lightweight, goal-based digital piggy bank where users can:

- Set specific savings goals with priorities  
- Add money periodically  
- Automatically distribute funds using smart logic  
- Visualize their progress in a simple, motivating way  

By gamifying and simplifying saving, WishWallet helps users stay focused and consistent with their financial goals.

## 🚀 Project Overview

WishWallet allows users to:

- Create multiple financial goals (e.g., Buy a phone, Trip to Manali)
- Assign a **target amount** and **priority** to each goal
- Add money to a digital piggy bank
- Automatically distribute money to goals using a **priority-based greedy approach**
- Track progress via a **visual progress bar**
- Remove completed goals from the dashboard with a success message

## 📚 DSA Concepts Used

| Concept         | Implementation Purpose |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| **HashMap**     | For storing and accessing goals using goal names |
| **PriorityQueue** | For automatically sorting goals by priority (lower number = higher priority) |
| **Greedy Algorithm** | For distributing added money efficiently among goals |
| **Custom Comparator** | Used to sort goals by priority and remaining amount |

## 🛠️ Features

- 🎯 Add financial goals with name, amount, and priority
- 💰 Add money to the piggy bank anytime
- 📊 View all current goals with dynamic progress bars
- ✅ Goals disappear automatically once completed, with a Toast congratulation message
- 📱 Clean, simple Android UI with intuitive buttons

---

## 💡 How It Works (Logic Breakdown)

1. When a user adds money, all goals are sorted using a **PriorityQueue**.
2. The app uses a **Greedy Allocation Algorithm** to:
   - Start with the **highest priority goal**
   - Allocate as much money as needed
   - Move to the next goal once the current one is filled
3. Internally, goal progress is tracked using the `savedAmount` vs `targetAmount`.
4. Completed goals are removed.
