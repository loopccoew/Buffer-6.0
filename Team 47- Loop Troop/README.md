# 🏠 TokenVest - Real Estate Token Investment Platform

## 📌 Problem Statement

Real estate investment has traditionally been capital-intensive, making it inaccessible for individuals with limited funds. TokenVest aims to solve this problem by introducing **tokenized property investment**. Instead of purchasing an entire property, users can buy **tokens**—each representing a share of the property—making real estate investment more **affordable, flexible, and inclusive**.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**TokenVest** is a Java-based investment platform that brings the concept of **fractional ownership** into the real estate space. By dividing properties into tokens, users can invest small amounts and own a share in premium real estate projects. The system supports two types of users: **Admin** and **Investor**, each with specific roles and access rights.

The project is implemented using core Java with a **console interface** (extendable to a Swing GUI) and uses **in-memory data structures** like ArrayList and HashMap for storing and managing application data.
