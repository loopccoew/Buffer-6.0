# Women's Safety Application

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In today’s world, personal safety—especially for women—remains a major concern, often compromised by delayed emergency responses, unclear or unsafe routes, and difficulty accessing timely legal support. Many existing safety solutions fall short; they lack real-time risk alerts, predictive analysis, and trustworthy options for reporting crimes anonymously. This gap leaves individuals feeling vulnerable and unsupported in moments when swift action is critical.

There is a growing need for a reliable, all-in-one platform that not only identifies safer routes using real-time data but also enables quick access to emergency contacts, highlights crime-prone areas, facilitates secure and anonymous crime reporting, and connects users to legal aid when they need it the most. Such a solution could empower users to make faster, more informed decisions and allow authorities to respond more efficiently—ultimately creating safer communities for everyone.

## 📊 Data Structures and Algorithms Used

### 🗺 Graph (HashMap)
- **Use:** To model city routes between areas.
- **Why:** Nodes = areas, Edges = routes with safety & time scores.

### 🔍 Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- **Use:** To find the safest and fastest route.
- **Why:** Optimal path selection using safety + time as weights.

### ⏳ PriorityQueue
- **Use:** Selects next best node (route) in Dijkstra’s.
- **Why:** Efficient node traversal based on total score.

### 📚 Array & ArrayList
- **Use:**
  - Array: Emergency contacts (fixed size).
  - ArrayList: Lawyers & route paths (dynamic lists).
- **Why:** Arrays are fast, ArrayLists are flexible.

### 🧭 HashMap
- **Use:** Store graph data and lookup locations.
- **Why:** Fast O(1) access to area connections.
