## 🔑 Key Features and Implementations

### 🧠 Data Structures Used

- **Stack**: Stores buy and sell transactions for tracking historical data and analyzing investment performance.  
- **Priority Queue**: Organizes stocks based on market capitalization for efficient retrieval of top-performing stocks.  
- **Linked List**: Manages a user’s wishlist with dynamic addition/removal of stocks.  
- **HashMap**: Maintains a user’s stock portfolio with stock symbols as keys and their quantities as values.  
- **Binary Tree**: Efficiently stores and searches market stocks, enables filtering by cap size (large, mid, small) and sector (IT, FMCG, Textiles, Oil, etc.).  
- **Max Heap**: Retrieves top-performing stocks, giving a concise view of the market.  
- **Graph**: Represents inter-stock influence within sectors using an adjacency matrix. Influence strength is derived from a correlation matrix of 20-day price data, fetched using Python’s `yfinance` library.  
- **Set**: Tracks unique sectors in the user’s portfolio to evaluate diversification and suggest underrepresented sectors.
