Currency Converter:  
This program allows users to convert currency amounts between various international currencies. It supports adding new currencies, removing existing ones, and maintains a conversion history with undo/redo functionality.

Data Structures Used:  
- HashMap: Used in the currency storage for mapping currency names to their corresponding Currency objects (which hold the name and exchange rate).  
- Stack: Utilized to implement undo and redo features for conversion history, allowing users to revert or reapply previous conversions.  
- ArrayList: Keeps a sequential list of all conversion records for display and tracking purposes.
