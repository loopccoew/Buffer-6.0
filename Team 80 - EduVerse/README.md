# EduVerse ðŸŽ“  
**Theme:** *Next-Gen Academic Solutions*

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
**EduVerse** is a smart matchmaking system designed to pair students with ideal study buddies based on their academic interests, availability, and performance. The goal is to improve collaborative learning by building meaningful academic partnerships through intelligent recommendations.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Students often struggle to find the right peer to study with â€” someone who shares common academic topics, is available at the same time, and complements their learning style. EduVerse, a Java console based project, solves this by analyzing each student's interests, performance scores, and time slots, and then suggests the most compatible matches using graph-based analysis and weighted scoring.

## ðŸ§° Data Structures Used
EduVerse makes use of the following core data structures and concepts:

1. **HashMap**:  
  For storing user data, buddy pairs, pending requests, and session records.

2. **HashSet**:  
  To handle unique sets of topics and availability slots.

3. **ArrayList**:  
  For dynamic storage of sessions, edges, and suggestions.

4. **PriorityQueue**:  
  For efficiently retrieving top K compatibility matches.

5. **Graph**:  
  Users are modeled as nodes in a graph, with weighted edges representing compatibility scores.
