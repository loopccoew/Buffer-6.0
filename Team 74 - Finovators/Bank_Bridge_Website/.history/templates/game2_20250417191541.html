        <p>In this game, you will learn how banks detect frauds using algorithms and data structures like HashMaps, Heaps, and Graphs.</p>
        <p>Fraud detection systems look for suspicious patterns in transactions such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unusually large amounts</li>
            <li>Multiple transactions in a short time</li>
            <li>Transactions from distant locations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you progress, you’ll play the role of a fraud analyst and catch the fraudsters!</p>
