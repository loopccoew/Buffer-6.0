📚 Data Structure Visualizer - Next-Gen Academic Solution

🎯 Problem Statement
Understanding Data Structures is essential for computer science students, but traditional methods often rely only on static diagrams and theory. This gap between concept and execution makes it difficult for students to truly grasp how data structures evolve during operations.
 -Data Structure Visualizer solves this by providing an interactive console-based Java application where users can perform operations and see real-time ASCII 
  visualizations.
 -It offers both a Standard Mode for practicing CRUD operations and a Learning Mode for step-by-step explanations, ASCII visuals at each step, and mini quizzes to 
  reinforce learning.
 -By combining visualization, interaction, and quizzes, this project makes Data Structures intuitive, engaging, and easy to master.
