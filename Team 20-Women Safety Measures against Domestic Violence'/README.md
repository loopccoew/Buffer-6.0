## 💡 Project Overview / Problem Statement
This project addresses a critical social issue: many women remain in abusive or toxic marriages due to **financial dependency**.  
Our goal is to empower these women by connecting them with **relevant job opportunities**—helping them achieve **financial independence** and regain control of their lives.

## 🚀 What the System Does
- Collects women’s profiles (name, job interests, location) using a **linked list**.
- Accepts job postings from employers and categorizes them based on fields like IT, Finance, Education, etc.
- Connects users to jobs using a **graph-based recommendation system**.
- Recommends the **top 2 high-paying jobs per category** based on their profile.
- Tracks each job application using a **queue and status linked list**, with updates like `Applied`, `Interview Scheduled`, or `Selected`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Data Structures
- **Language**: Python
- **Data Structures Used**:  
  - Linked List (for profiles and status tracking)  
  - Queue (for managing applications)  
  - Graph (for job recommendation)  
  - Dictionary (for category mapping)
