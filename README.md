Orphan Fund Management System
Problem Statement
The Orphan Fund Management System aims to efficiently manage donations and allocate funds to orphanages and shelters. The system allows donors to contribute funds and helps prioritize fund requests based on urgency. It ensures that orphanages receive the necessary support on time, while tracking donations and fund allocations. This system also keeps a record of all transactions, ensuring transparency and accountability.
