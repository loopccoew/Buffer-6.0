# Women-Harassment-Detection
# Protect. Detect. Empower.
# Overview
Tech Features That Safeguard Women, One Message at a Time.
A Streamlit-based web app that detects online harassment from user-submitted text using an ML model. If harassment is detected, it encodes a report with message, sender details, and location metadata to help authorities take action.

# Data Structures Used
 **1.pandas.DataFrame**
 
 📍 Used in:
- Reading and displaying CSV data
- Passing user message input to the model
  
 🔎 Why:
- Structured format suitable for ML
- Compatible with `scikit-learn` pipelines

 **2.list**
 
 📍 Used in:
- Collecting values (labels, sizes) for plotting
- Creating the heap in Huffman encoding
  
 🔎 Why:
- Dynamic and easy to manipulate
- Supports priority queues via `heapq`

  **3. dict**
  
 📍 Used in:
- Storing frequency counts
- Huffman encoding map
- Reverse lookup during decoding
- IP and location API responses
  
 🔎 Why:
- O(1) average time complexity for lookups
- Flexible for structured data mapping

**4. defaultdict**

 📍 Used in:
- Counting character frequency in `create_frequency_dict`
  
 🔎 Why:
- Prevents key errors while incrementing
- Cleaner and safer syntax than regular `dict`

 **5. heapq` (Min Heap using list)**
 
 📍 Used in:
- `build_huffman_tree()` for character priority
  
 🔎 Why:
- Huffman coding needs the two least frequent elements repeatedly
- Efficient for implementing priority queue

 **6. tuple**
 
 📍 Used in:
- Storing `(char, encoding)` pairs
- Returning multiple values like latitude, longitude
  
 🔎 Why:
- Lightweight, immutable group of values
- Ideal for returning compact data from functions
- 
  **7. `str` (String)**
  
 📍 Used in:
- User inputs
- Huffman text compression
- File naming
- Report formatting

 🔎 Why:
- Native support for encoding/decoding operations
- Fast and memory-efficient for text
- 
  **8. Custom `Linked List`**
  
 📍 Used in:
- Organizing and displaying phone number and IP address metadata for reports
  
 🔎 Why:
- Good for sequential insertion without resizing
- Educational purpose — reinforces understanding of pointers and nodes
- 
  **9.`Huffman Tree` (Nested List/Tree Structure)**
  
 📍 Used in:
- build_huffman_tree() 
  The tree is built like:
  python
  [total_weight, [char1, code1], [char2, code2], ...]
  
 🔎 Why:
- The **binary tree** represents prefix codes for each character
- Left child adds `'0'`, right child adds `'1'`
- Helps generate **minimum average bit-length** encoding
 🔺 Example:
If you encode `"aabbbc"`, the tree might look like:
python
[6,
 ['c', '00'],
 ['a', '01'],
 ['b', '1']
]
Each `[char, code]` pair shows the binary code assigned to that character.
