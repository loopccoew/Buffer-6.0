PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Managing finances—whether personal or business—is still a fragmented and often stressful experience.
While many apps exist, none offer a unified, intelligent, and customizable platform that caters to both personal and business financial planning in one space.

OUR SOLUTION : ** KHOJ-CASH**

Khoj Cash is a smart, web-based financial planner designed to simplify and empower financial management for both users as well as business owners.
It combines intuitive interfaces with automation, goal tracking, and insights—helping users make confident, data-driven financial decisions.

DATA STRUCTURES USED : 

 List is used for storing users, transactions, goals, and reminders because it maintains insertion order, allows duplicates, and is easy to iterate and append to. It's chosen over dictionaries when order and duplicates matter.

 Class is used to represent entities like users, goals, and reminders, as it encapsulates both data and behavior. It provides better structure and reusability compared to plain dictionaries.

 Linked List is used for managing debts dynamically since it allows efficient insertions and deletions in between nodes. It’s preferred over lists and dictionaries when node chaining and sequential access are important.

 Heap is used for autopay scheduling to efficiently manage tasks by priority. It gives quick access to the minimum (or next due) item, unlike lists or dictionaries which don’t handle priority ordering well.

Dictionary is used for mapping users, goals, and reminders by ID or name because it allows fast lookups, updates, and ensures key uniqueness. It’s preferred over lists when quick key-based access is needed.
