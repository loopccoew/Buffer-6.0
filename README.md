# SheSafe-PathFinder
# PathfinderApp üö¶

## üß† Project Description

**PathfinderApp** is a Java-based GUI application designed to compute the *safest path* between two nodes in a graph using risk scores as edge weights. It simulates a real-world application like emergency evacuation planning, secure routing, or urban navigation where safety is prioritized over distance.

The graph's nodes and edges are stored in a **MySQL** database and loaded dynamically at runtime. Each edge has a **risk score** calculated from various risk parameters (`CSS`, `SLF`, `PPI`, `PPS`). 
CSS- Crime Severity Score,
SLF- Street Light Factor,
PPI- Police Present Index,
PPS- Public Survelliance Score,
Using **Dijkstra's algorithm**, the app determines the path with the lowest total risk.

With an intuitive **Java Swing GUI**, users can:

- Enter source and destination nodes
- View the safest route and its total risk score
- Trigger **Emergency Mode** to view local emergency contacts
- Rate the safety of locations
- View the **Top 5 Safest Locations** as rated by users

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### üîç Safest Path Finder
- Computes the safest path between any two locations based on cumulative risk score.
- Utilizes Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm to ensure optimal path selection.

### üö® Emergency Mode
- Users can click an **"Emergency" button**.
- Based on the user‚Äôs **current location**, emergency contacts (like police, hospital, fire station) for that area are fetched from the database and displayed.

### ‚≠ê Location Safety Rating
- Users can **rate the safety** of a location (1 to 5 stars).
- Ratings are stored in the database.
- A section displays the **Top 5 Safest Locations** based on average user ratings.

### üß≠ User-Friendly Interface
- Java Swing-based interface for easy input and visual feedback.
- Scrollable result area with clearly formatted output.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Structures Used

### 1. **Graph (Adjacency List)**
- `Map<String, List<Edge>>`: Represents the entire network of nodes and edges.
- Efficient for traversal and neighbor lookups in sparse graphs.

### 2. **Edge**
- Fields: `to` (destination node), `riskScore` (sum of multiple factors)
- Each connection between nodes is weighted with a cumulative risk score.

### 3. **Priority Queue**
- Used in Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm to always pick the node with the current lowest risk.
- Efficient pathfinding with dynamic updates of minimum scores.

### 4. **HashMaps**
- `dist`: Stores minimum risk from source to all other nodes.
- `prev`: Stores the predecessor node for reconstructing the path.

## üß© Technologies Used

- **Java 11+**

- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**
- **MySQL**


# üõ°Ô∏è PathFinder Database Schema

PathFinder is a safety-focused navigation system designed to guide users through the safest routes within a city or region. It combines real-time crowd-sourced data, emergency services integration, and smart pathfinding algorithms to ensure user safety during travel.

This repository contains the **MySQL database schema** used by the PathFinder system. Below is a breakdown of all tables, their relationships, and how they support the overall functionality of the platform.
