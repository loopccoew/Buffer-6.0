## 💡 Features
- Safe route suggestions is based on distance, unsafe areas and time of day
- Emergency contact queue  
- SOS voice trigger  
- Nearby safe spaces & emergency services  

## 🚀 Technologies
- Backend: Python, Flask  
- Mapping: Geopy
- APIs: OpenRouteService,Folium,NetworkX  
- Frontend: HTML 

## 📊 Data Structures & Algorithms

### 🔠 Trie – SOS Voice Detection
- Stores distress words (e.g., "help", "save me").
- Enables fast O(k) keyword matching from live voice input.
- Ensures real-time voice-based emergency triggers.

### 🧮 Min-Heap – Emergency Contact Queue
- Prioritizes emergency contacts based on importance.
- Supports efficient retrieval of highest-priority contact.
- Ensures quick and structured alerting.

### 🌐 Graph (Weighted) – Safe Route Mapping
- City modeled as a graph: intersections = nodes, roads = edges.
- Edge weights include crime rate, lighting conditions, etc.
- Dynamic safety scoring based on area attributes.

### 🧭 Dijkstra's Algorithm – Safest Path
- Finds the safest route, not just shortest.
- Weights minimize crime exposure and maximize well-lit areas.
- Efficient and widely trusted shortest path algorithm.

 ## 📚 Libraries Used
- Flask – lightweight web framework for building the backend  
- Folium – for generating interactive maps with Python  
- NetworkX – for graph-based route and safety calculations  
- Geopy – for geolocation and distance calculations  
- SpeechRecognition – for detecting SOS words via microphone  
- OpenRouteService – for fetching walking/driving routes  
- Requests – for making HTTP requests to APIs
