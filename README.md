# Team100_Disaster-Relief-Resource-Reallocation

This is a disaster relief resource allocation project which is divided into two parts volunteer and victim
Victim part consists of hashmap and array list to store nearby, farby, shopping centres and shelters according to severity of disaster
We have also included graphs to help the victims find the shortest path from one area to other.

We have included a rescue van which can be tracked by the victim time to time.

In volunteer section, we have included 3 options (after filling their information) for aids of victim,that is financial,food and 
medical facilities. Djikstara's Algorithm is used for volunteers to find the shortest distance from their place to the place of disaster.
