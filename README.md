This project is a command-line based Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Detector that simulates a simplified crypto dashboard. It displays real-time arbitrage opportunities, shows profitable trading paths, calculates potential profit, and provides detailed buy and sell price comparisons across markets.  
It models the currencies and their exchange rates as a directed graph, where each node represents a currency and edges represent conversion rates.The system uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect arbitrage by identifying negative weight cycles in a graph structure that models currency exchange rates. 
Key data structures include HashMap for managing the graph and currency data, ArrayList for storing edges and currency lists, and StringBuilder for generating structured and readable CLI output â€” all contributing to an efficient and feature-rich crypto analysis tool.
