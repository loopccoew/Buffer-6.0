## 🧠 Project Overview  
**BankBridge** is a gamified fintech awareness platform designed to educate middle school students (Grades 5–8) about essential financial concepts such as:

- Banking operations  
- Fraud detection  
- Credit scores  
- Transaction management  

Built with **Python Flask (backend)** and **HTML/CSS (frontend)**, the platform combines storytelling, gameplay, and DSA-based simulations to make learning about finance fun and interactive.

## ⚙️ Key Modules & DSA Implementation  

### 🏦 1. Account Management System  
- **Concept:** Simulates student bank accounts with deposits, withdrawals, and balance tracking.  
- **Learning Outcome:** Teaches students the basics of managing money and understanding bank accounts.

---

### 🛡️ 2. Fraud Detection System  
- **Concept:** Educates students on recognizing phishing attempts and ATM/card frauds.  
- **Games Based On:**  
  - Fake messages/emails asking for PINs or OTPs  
  - ATM skimmer/fake card reader detection  
- **Learning Outcome:** Encourages safe banking habits and fraud awareness.  
- **DSA Used:**  
  - `Lists` for tracking options and responses  
  - `Graphs` for pathfinding in ATM navigation games

---

### 📊 3. Credit Score Simulator  
- **Concept:** Introduces credit scores and how behavior affects them.  
- **Game Idea:** Players make financial choices (e.g., paying bills on time, overspending) that influence their score.  
- **Learning Outcome:** Demonstrates the impact of responsible financial decisions.  
- **DSA Used:**  
  - `Arrays` to simulate decision outcomes and score tracking

---

### 💳 4. Transaction Simulation Using Stacks and Queues  
- **Concept:** Models safe banking transactions with error-handling principles.  
- **Game Rules:**  
  - **All or Nothing:** Transactions must succeed completely or not at all  
  - **No Negative Balance:** Spending beyond available funds is prohibited  
- **Learning Outcome:** Reinforces safe money transfer logic and consistency.  
- **DSA Used:**  
  - `Stacks` for undo operations (LIFO)  
  - `Queues` for transaction order and processing (FIFO)
