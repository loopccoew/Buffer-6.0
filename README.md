This Python program offers two main features for students:

1. Scholarship Finder – Students can input their caste category, annual family income, and disability status. Based on this data, the program recommends scholarships they may be eligible for, helping reduce financial barriers to education.

2. Club Recommender – Students can enter their personal interests, and the program suggests relevant clubs they might enjoy joining. This promotes student engagement and helps them connect with like-minded peers.

Overall, the tool supports both academic and social development for students by making useful opportunities more accessible.
