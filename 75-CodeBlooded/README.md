Problem Statement:
The Currency Exchange Optimizer helps users convert one currency to another at the most optimal rate using real-time exchange rates fetched from an external API. It identifies the best conversion path between two currencies using graph-based logic and provides a breakdown of the final amount in common currency denominations.

Data Structures Used:
Graph (Map<String, List<Edge>>)
Priority Queue (PriorityQueue<Node>)
Custom Classes (Edge, Node, Result)
List and Set
Map for Denominations (Map<Integer, Integer>)
