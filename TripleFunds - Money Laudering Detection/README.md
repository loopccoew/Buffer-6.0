## 📊 Problem Statement
Fraudulent money laundering through small transactions - Fraudsters break up large amounts of money into smaller transactions and spread them across fake accounts to hide where the money came from. Since each small transaction looks normal, traditional fraud detection systems often miss these activities, making it hard to spot the bigger fraud.
