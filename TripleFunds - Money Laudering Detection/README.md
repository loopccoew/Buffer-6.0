## 📊 Problem Statement
Fraudulent money laundering through small transactions - Fraudsters break up large amounts of money into smaller transactions and spread them across fake accounts to hide where the money came from. Since each small transaction looks normal, traditional fraud detection systems often miss these activities, making it hard to spot the bigger fraud.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- NetworkX
- Google Colab

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset is too large for GitHub, so we have uploaded it to Google Drive.

## 📝 How to Run the Code
1. Download the dataset from the above link.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
3. Run each cell step by step.

## ✅ Output
