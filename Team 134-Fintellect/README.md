Project Title  
Fintellect: Smart Financial Planner 

Problem Statement  
Despite increasing financial independence among young adults, there exists a significant gap between income generation and informed financial decision-making. Existing tools are often too complex or generic, lacking educational value.  

This project proposes an advanced, algorithm-driven financial simulator leveraging data structures and real-world data to empower users with actionable insights in investment strategies, savings optimization, tax efficiency, and goal prioritizationâ€”bridging the critical gap between financial literacy and strategic execution.

Features  

1. Portfolio Optimization  
   Helps users maximize returns within a given budget.  
   Uses the Fractional Knapsack Algorithm to select full or partial investments based on return-to-cost ratio.

2. Goal Dependency Tracker  
   Organizes and prioritizes financial goals.  
   Uses a Graph-Based Approach to map dependencies and resolve them using Topological Sorting.

3. Risk Profile Simulator  
   Determines the user's risk tolerance based on financial attributes like age, savings, and loans.  
   Categorizes users as "Conservative," "Balanced," or "Aggressive."

4. Personalized Fund Recommendations  
   Suggests funds based on user preferences for return, risk, and tenure.  
   Uses a Weighted Scoring Algorithm to rank funds.

Technologies Used  
Programming Language: Java  
Development Environment: Visual Studio Code  
Data Structures: Arrays, HashMaps, Graphs, Custom Classes  
Algorithms: Fractional Knapsack, Weighted Scoring, Topological Sorting

Strengths of the Project  
1. Efficiency  
   The use of the Fractional Knapsack Algorithm ensures optimal budget utilization  
   Sorting investments by return-to-cost ratio improves decision-making

2. User-Friendliness  
   Simple and interactive interface for entering investment details and viewing results

3. Scalability  
   Can handle a large number of investments efficiently due to O(n log n) sorting complexity

4. Real-World Applicability  
   Provides actionable insights for users to make smarter financial decisions

Future Enhancements  
1. Integration with Real-Time Market Data  
   Fetch live data for investments to provide more accurate recommendations

2. Risk-Based Filtering  
   Automatically filter out investments that exceed the user's risk tolerance

3. Mobile Application  
   Develop a mobile-friendly version for wider accessibility

4. Tax Optimization  
   Suggest tax-saving investments based on user profiles
