Our problem statement comprises of the creation of a study planner that will help students keep a track of their study sessions.Along with a regular study planner we have also added a special feature of mini games, which the users can play while simultaneously answering questions based on the topics they want to study.



The data structures that we have used in this project are : Maps, HashMap, Array(for Snakes and Ladders mini game and tic-tac-toe) and ArrayList(study planner).
