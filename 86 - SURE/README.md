## 🚀 Project Overview
**Problem Statement:** Syllabus-Based Educational Resource Recommendation Platform

**SURE (Syllabus-based Useful Resource Explorer)** is a smart academic support tool that allows students to upload their **syllabus PDF** and instantly receive a list of **relevant YouTube videos** and **web resources** for each topic.

It uses **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** such as **priority queues**, **text similarity ranking**, and **custom parsing logic** to extract topics and recommend learning material — all in a few seconds.

> ✨ Say goodbye to wasting time on irrelevant search results!
