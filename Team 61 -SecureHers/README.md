---

## 🔍 Overview:
**SecureHers** is a smart path-finding system built to enhance **women’s safety in urban areas**. It uses **graph-based algorithms** and **real-time user feedback** to prioritize safe navigation over just the shortest route.

---

## 🧠 Core Technology:
- Utilizes **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** on a weighted graph, where edges represent roads with safety ratings.
- Applies **A\*** Algorithm to locate the **nearest safest spot** from the user’s current location, factoring in both **distance** and **safety levels**.

---

## 📌 Key Features:

### ✅ Three-Parameter Safety Rating:
Each road segment is evaluated based on:
- 🔦 Presence of Streetlights  
- 📷 Availability of CCTV Cameras  
- 👥 Crowd Density  

### 🧭 Safest Route Finder:
- Suggests routes that **maximize safety** using **real-time weighted graph calculations**.

### 📍 Nearest Safe Location Finder:
- Guides users to the **nearest safe area** in case of emergencies.

### 🔐 Admin Login System:
Admins can:
- 🔧 Modify or reset safety ratings  
- 📊 Manage and oversee feedback data  

### 🙋‍♀️ User Registration & Login:
Required for:
- 🛡️ Secured access  
- 🗣️ Submitting verified safety feedback  

### 🧾 Encrypted Passwords:
- User credentials are stored securely using **basic encryption mechanisms**.

### 📦 Modular Architecture:
- Clean separation of logic across **multiple classes** for **scalability** and **maintainability**.

---

## 🌟 Unique Value Proposition (UVP):
### 📢 Community-Driven Safety System:
- After completing a route, users are prompted to **rate their experience based on safety**.
- Feedback is used to **update safety ratings**, making the system:
  - Dynamic  
  - Evolving  
  - User-informed
